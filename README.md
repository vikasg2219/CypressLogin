Login and Authentication Flow Test Suite

This repository contains an automated test suite for testing the login and authentication flow of a SaaS (Software as a Service) application using Cypress.

Prerequisites

Before running the test suite, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Cypress (installed locally)

 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikasg2219/CypressLogin.git
   cd login
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `users.json` file with test user credentials. Refer to the provided example in this repository and customize it with your test user data.

Running the Test Suite

To run the test suite using Cypress, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

   cd path/to/login

2. Run Cypress using the following command:

   npx cypress open

3. The Cypress Test Runner will open. Click on the test spec `login.cy.js` under the "e2e" section.

4. Cypress will open a browser window and start running the test cases. You can watch the tests being executed and observe the results in real-time.

 Test Data and Configuration

- Modify the `users.json` file to include the test user credentials and scenarios relevant to your SaaS application's login and authentication flow.

 Environment Variables

- Configure the `cypress.json` file with environment variables for different user scenarios. These variables are used to provide test data to the test scripts if required.

- Update the test scripts in `login.cy.js` to use the environment variables appropriately.

 Customization

- Adapt the test suite code in `login.cy.js` to match your SaaS application's login page structure, element IDs, URLs, and assertions.

- Customize the error messages, assertions, and verifications based on your application's behavior.

 Reporting

Cypress provides detailed test execution reports. You can find the generated reports in the `cypress/reports` directory after running the test suite.
